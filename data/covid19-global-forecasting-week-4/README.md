## Covid19 Dataset 
### Files
- ```train.csv``` - the training data (you are encouraged to join in many more useful external datasets)
- ```test.csv``` - the dates to predict; there is a week of overlap with the training data for the initial Public leaderboard. Once submissions are paused, the Public leaderboard will update based on last 28 days of predicted data.
- ```submission.csv``` - a sample submission in the correct format; again, predictions should be cumulative
